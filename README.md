# CPX-Breakout
This template project is a KiCAD template for expansion boards to go with [Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333).

The finished board is bolted to the back of the Circuit Playground Express using M3 screws and distance rolls. The bolts and rolls provide both mechanical stability and electrical contact.

To install, clone the repository _into a __separate__ folder, __not__ directly into the template folder_ or download and extract the zip file, then copy the `CPX-Breakout` folder out of the repository into your personal template directory. Under Linux this usually is `~/kicad/template`.
